== Description ==

The best and most flexible tag cloud generator for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/ "Your favorite software") sites. Easy to implement with shortcode, easy to style and can show a cloud of lists of various taxonomies. It can even display manually created lists with hyperlinks.

*Wolfe Candy Tag Cloud* is part of the *Wolfe Candy* suite of plugins that all work together to make [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/ "Your favorite software") site creation that much easier.

Major features include:

* Configable style options using short-code, URL POST arguments or default settings or factory defaults.
* Default values make calling a cloud easy.
* Styles and order can be randomised.
* Size of tags can be displayed according to rating scores.
* Any font that is supported by the browser can be used.
* Insert anywhere within posts or pages.
* Show a cloud of any taxonomy including post_tag, category or any custom taxonomy.
* Programatically or manually create a cloud based on ANY list.

It is completely FREE - development and maintenance by the *Wolfe Candy* team headed by *Jrack Wolfe* is funded through [donations](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=DY2RMD3J4SR3Q "Donate to Wolfe Candy") from generous users.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use the tag cloud programatically? =

Yes - the tag cloud is created as a class that can easily be called and configured. The manual is a text file distributed with the code. 

= Can I display a cloud of categories? =

Yes - use the shortcode argument to simply change taxonomy.

= Can I configure it using the admin dashboard? =

Yes - but this requires the FREE *Wolfe Candy Tool Suite* plugin to be installed first. Tag Cloud settings will appear automatically in the Wolfe Candy Settings dashboard.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin, activate it, and then place the shortcode where you want it to display.

It is recommended that the *Wolfe Candy Tool Suite* is also installed as this provides a user manual for the tag cloud and a screen of fully configurable options, but it is not a requirement.
