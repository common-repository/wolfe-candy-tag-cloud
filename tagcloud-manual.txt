<h1>Getting the Most out of the Wolfe Candy Tag Cloud Generator</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Tag Cloud generator creates a tag cloud at the point in a page or post that it is required using short code.</p>
<p>Settings can be set using short-code arguments. If provided then these will also override any default settings so that a tag cloud can be altered on a post by post or page by page basis.</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>The following are the default settings that influence how a tag cloud is created and displayed. These settings
can be overridden by passing short-code arguments or POST URL arguments.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Follow the usual Wordpress instructions to install the plugin files. Either copy a ZIP archive of the plugin folder contents into the Wordpress plugins folder or install it directly from the Wordpress repositiory.</p>

<h2>Shortcode</h2>
<p>Use <b>[tag-cloud]</b> to show a tag cloud using default settings, short-code args, POST or GET URL args e.g. https://.....page.php?[arg]=xxxx.</p>
<p>Use <b>[tag-cloud [arg1]="xxxxxxxx" [arg2]="xxxxxxxx"] </b> to use short-code args.</p><br>
<li>style_box_color="LightGrey" 	: specify as text or hex
<li>style_border_color="darkblue"	: specify as text or hex
<li>style_border_width="1px"		: specify as pixels
<li>style_box_width="75%"		: specify as % to allow for mobile themes
<li>style_box_padding="2px"		: specify as pixels
<li>style_font_color="#4F5AA1" 	: must be in hex if it needs to be randomised or shaded
<li>style_min_font_size=10
<li>style_max_font_size=35 		: Increasing this will make the text larger, decreasing will make it smaller
<li>style_set_font=""				: set a font for all tags or else they will be randomly selected between "Arial", "Arial Narrow", "Times", "Helvetica", "Calibri", "Verdana", "Courier", "Candara", "Geneva", "Optima", "Cambria", "Garamond", "Didot", "Perpetua", "Copper Plate". NB: defaults to "Arial" if font specified is not supported by the browser.
<li>style_random=true	 			: randomise with italics and bold text
<br>
<li>style_shade_spread=25 		: if "random shade" is true then this is the random rgb value spread of the shading - this only works if color is specified in hex format
<li>style_shade_random=true	 	: randomise the text shade/tints
<li>style_color_random=true 		: choose random base color
<li>style_multi_random=true 		: choose random base color each time
<br>		
<li>style_tag_separator="&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"	: the characters that divide each tab
<br>
<li>list_random=true				: list in a random order or in the array order
<li>list_vertical=true			: include vertical text
<li>list_use_ratings=false		: use ratings in an array to specify size (false = random)
<li>list_max=100					: max number of tags to be displayed
<br>		
<li>return_url="current"			: URL of return page for links - blank for no link, "current" if return to current page
<li>tag_list_mode=""   			: specify the taxonomy to use. The default is "post_tag" but can be set for any taxonomy.

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<li>This plugin can make use of the <b>Wolfe Candy Tool Suite</b> framework. If active, the <b>Settings/Wolfe Candy Settings</b> provides and interface where all the shortcode settings are configurable via the Admin dashboard.

<h2>Wordpress Developers</h2>
<p><b>The tag cloud</b> is a class that is initiated using <b>$tag_cloud = new WlfC_TagCloud;</b>. The args listed in the shortcode above are available <b>$tag_cloud->[arg]</b>. In addition to these, the following are available programatically:</p>
<li><b>$tag_cloud->SetDefaults($_atts);</b> to be called within any shortcode function and passes the shortcode arguments through.
<li><b>$tag_cloud->GetDefaults();</b> returns an array of factory defaults and setting options that can be used in a shortcode function e.g. <b>$atts = shortcode_atts( $tag_cloud->GetDefaults(), $_atts );</b>.
<li>The main list of tags is stored in <b>$tag_cloud->tag_list;</b>. This is an array in the following format so you can pass the tag array directly to the class.
<p>$tag_cloud->tag_list = array(<br>
	&nbsp;@nbsp;	'tag1'=>array('link'=>'URL1', 'rating'=>'10'),<br>
	&nbsp;@nbsp;	'tag2'=>array('link'=>'URL2', 'rating'=>'5'),<br>
	&nbsp;@nbsp;	'tag3'=>array('link'=>'URL3', 'rating'=>'9'),<br>
	&nbsp;@nbsp;	'tag4'=>array('link'=>'URL4', 'rating'=>'9')<br>
);</p>
<li><b>$tag_cloud->AddTag('[name]','[rating]','[link]');</b> is used to add a tag to the list. This can also be used to start a list. [rating] and [link] are optional.
<li><b>$tag_cloud->GetSelected();</b> function sets the argument <b>$tag_cloud->selected_tag;</b> as the name of the last tag selected which can be used programmatically locally to process a clicked tag.
<li><b>$tag_cloud->SetURL();</b> sets the <b>$tag_cloud->return_url</b> to the current page - which is the same as setting it to "current"
<li><b>$tag_cloud->SetWPTags([taxonomy]);</b> returns an array in tag cloud format of all Word Press tags and links for the specific taxonomy (e.g. "post_tag" or "category"). This means it can be used to tag cloud all types of custom post objects. The taxonomoy defaults to "post_tag". It returns unassigned tags . It also resets the <b>$tag_cloud->tag_list;</b> to be the Word Press Tags array.
<li><b>$tag_cloud->GetHTML();</b> returns the HTML code for the tag cloud. It is blank if the tag array is empty.
<br>
<li><b>$tag_cloud->color_name_to_hex("color")</b> is a utility function in the class to turn text colors into hex values
<li><b>$tag_cloud->strRGB("hex", "r")</b> is a utility function in the class to return either the r, g or b element of a hex colour
<li><b>$tag_cloud->random_base_color()</b> is a utility function in the class to return a random hex colour
<li><b>$tag_cloud->random_color("hex")</b> is a utility function in the class to return a random shade of a specified hex colour
